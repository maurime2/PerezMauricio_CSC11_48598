Review the C++ projects for Temperature Conversion and Drag Calculations.

Implement the temperature calculations as pure integer multiplications.

Implement the Drag calculation as pure integer multiplications.

Compare the time it takes for the temperature calculations with Assignment 7a and 7b.

You will need to loop as many times as it takes to have results that reach about 5 seconds for one vs. the other.

Flowchart your program, write the C++ equivalent, and of course provide the assembly.
