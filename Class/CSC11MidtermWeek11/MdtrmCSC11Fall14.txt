Note: Submit the Midterm to my RCC email account mark.lehr@rcc.edu
with the following subject:  LastName,FirstName - Midterm - 48598.

Submit the solutions/program in a zipped file.

Each problem requires a c-program solution, gliffy flowchart, and it's
raspberry pi assembly program for full credit.

Flowchart the menu as well as each function problem separately.  The
c++ program can be in one file.  The solutions need to be flow charted
separately.

Do the best you can and turn in as much as you can.  

1)  Develop an application that will determine the gross pay for 
employees. The company pays "straight-time" for the 
first 20 hours worked, double time for all hours worked in 
excess of 20 hours but less than 40 hours, and triple time for any 
hours worked over 40 hours. Inputs to the program would be hours
worked and rate of pay all of which are integers.  
Output would be gross pay.
Note:  60 hours maximum per week, so hours<=60


2) An ISP has 3 different subscription packages
	a)  $30 per month, 11 hours access.  Additional hours
	    are $3 up to 22 hours then $6 for all additional
		hours.
	b)  $35 per month, 22 hours access.  Additional hours
        are $2 up to 44 hours then $4 for each
		hour above this limit.
	c)  $40 per month, 33 hours access.  Additional hours
        are $1 up to 66 hours then $2 for each
		hour above this limit.
Write a program that calculates a customers monthly bill.  Ask which
package how many hours then display the monthly charge.  Input the 
monthly package as a or b or c for full credit.

3) Generate the Fibonacci sequence.  The input will be the 
term in the sequence to output.  The output will be that term
in the sequence.  Assume that the sequence starts at 0 for the 
first term {0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13, etc....}
For instance, Input -> 5, Output -> 3
The generating equation is Fi=Fi-1+Fi-2
