Many of these Weekly updates were taken from ThinkingGeek

They do a great job in supplementing our text book!

Refer to all the following for Chapters 1 to 21.

http://thinkingeek.com/2014/08/23/arm-assembler-raspberry-pi-chapter-21/

We won't use all the material but will use the elements that
correspond to our book.

Especially those related to creating functions, arrays, and
floating point variables.  If you can find any other useful 
references, let me know!
